# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-27)

**Core value:** Connect one Gradle dependency and get the full Aero-styled component set with three themes, custom window chrome, and a showcase — no manual style work required
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 3 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Use `undecorated=true` WITHOUT `transparent=true` — prevents Win11 EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (issue #3757); glass effect simulated via gradient
- Phase 1: Glass effect implemented in single `drawBehind` block to avoid overdraw and iGPU performance collapse
- Phase 1: Library module uses `compose.desktop.common` (not `currentOs`) to keep JAR platform-neutral
- Phase 3: AeroTitleBar placed in Phase 3 because it requires `FrameWindowScope` — only available in real window context
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Gradle 8.14.3 used (not 8.10.2) — cached locally, fully CMP 1.7.3 compatible
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Kotlin 2.1.21 / CMP 1.7.3 confirmed as actual published versions (RESEARCH.md cited non-existent 2.3.21/1.10.3)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: :library uses compose.desktop.common (platform-neutral JAR); :showcase uses compose.desktop.currentOs (native binary)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: AeroColorScheme drops 6 mordred domain tokens: connectionActive, connectionInactive, executionHighlight, logBackground, timeStampBackground, cardContent — application-specific, no meaning in a general UI library
- [Phase 01-foundation]: bodySmall retained on AeroTypography despite UI-SPEC removal — Plan 03 Material3 bridge maps MaterialTheme.typography.bodySmall to it; removing breaks the bridge
- [Phase 01-foundation]: @Immutable runtime reflection test replaced with isData check — Compose @Immutable uses BINARY retention (CLASS level), not visible at runtime; isData is correct runtime proxy
- [Phase 01-foundation]: defaultFactory pivot: ProvidableCompositionLocal.defaultFactory not public in CMP 1.7.3/Kotlin 2.1.21 — AeroThemeTest uses smoke tests per plan fallback
- [Phase 01-foundation]: JAVA_HOME must be JDK 17 (Gradle toolchain) for all Gradle invocations — Java 25 version string breaks Kotlin compiler JavaVersion.parse()

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Validate whether Win11 `undecorated+transparent` crash is fixed in CMP 1.10.3 (may have been patched — test in Phase 1)
- Phase 1: Decide Haze vs. gradient-only glass rendering after seeing demo output
- Phase 3: AeroTitleBar + native Aero Snap (HTCAPTION) requires spike — `WindowDraggableArea` does not pass HTCAPTION to OS; this is a documented limitation
