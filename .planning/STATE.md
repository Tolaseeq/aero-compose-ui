# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-27)

**Core value:** Connect one Gradle dependency and get the full Aero-styled component set with three themes, custom window chrome, and a showcase — no manual style work required
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Use `undecorated=true` WITHOUT `transparent=true` — prevents Win11 EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (issue #3757); glass effect simulated via gradient
- Phase 1: Glass effect implemented in single `drawBehind` block to avoid overdraw and iGPU performance collapse
- Phase 1: Library module uses `compose.desktop.common` (not `currentOs`) to keep JAR platform-neutral
- Phase 3: AeroTitleBar placed in Phase 3 because it requires `FrameWindowScope` — only available in real window context

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: Validate whether Win11 `undecorated+transparent` crash is fixed in CMP 1.10.3 (may have been patched — test in Phase 1)
- Phase 1: Decide Haze vs. gradient-only glass rendering after seeing demo output
- Phase 3: AeroTitleBar + native Aero Snap (HTCAPTION) requires spike — `WindowDraggableArea` does not pass HTCAPTION to OS; this is a documented limitation
