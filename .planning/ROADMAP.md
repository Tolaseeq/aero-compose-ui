### 🚧 v2.0.3 PanelGroup Recompose Fix (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** A patch release that eliminates section duplication in `AeroPanelGroup` when `Orientation.Horizontal` + controlled mode coincides with a section's content recomposing during an active divider drag — the root cause being an in-composition write to observed snapshot-state (`expandedState`) that is read in the same `BoxWithConstraints` pass. Then ship v2.0.3 on JitPack. Single phase (user-scoped). No breaking changes to the v2.x API; zero new dependencies; Compose stays 1.7.3.

- [ ] **Phase 14: PanelGroup Recompose Fix + v2.0.3 Release** — Compute `expandedArr` from `isExpanded()` each composition; move `expandedState` sync into `SideEffect`; ensure the seed-block doesn't mutate read-in-same-composition state; minimal showcase repro; vertical + uncontrolled regression-guarded; bump + tag + JitPack release (RCMP-01..04, REG-01..02, REL-01..02)

## Phase Details

### Phase 14: PanelGroup Recompose Fix + v2.0.3 Release
**Goal**: Eliminate horizontal-controlled section duplication under recompose-during-drag by removing the in-composition write to observed snapshot-state, with the vertical/uncontrolled paths byte-identical, then release v2.0.3 on JitPack.
**Depends on**: Phase 13.1 (the horizontal `AeroPanelGroupImpl` core this fix edits)
**Requirements**: RCMP-01, RCMP-02, RCMP-03, RCMP-04, REG-01, REG-02, REL-01, REL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. In `Orientation.Horizontal` + controlled mode, with a section's content recomposing during an active divider drag, sections do NOT duplicate — `N` declared `section(...)` render as exactly `N` header strips (previously `N`→×`N`, e.g. 3→9).
  2. No in-composition write to observed snapshot-state (`expandedState`/`sizePx`) that the same `BoxWithConstraints` pass reads: size-math reads `isExpanded()` directly each composition, `expandedState` sync is moved to `SideEffect`, and the seed-block does not mutate read-in-same-composition state (statically verifiable).
  3. Vertical + uncontrolled showcase behavior is byte-identical — drag-resize, collapse/expand animations (`snap()` during drag, `tween(200ms, FastOutSlowInEasing)` after), `onLayoutChange` on drag-end + toggle only, window-resize proportion preservation; the 12 `PanelGroupLogicTest` JVM tests stay GREEN; Compose stays 1.7.3 with zero new dependencies.
  4. A minimal showcase repro in `LayoutSection.kt` (horizontal controlled `AeroPanelGroup` whose one section's content reads an external `mutableStateOf` that changes during a divider drag) reproduces the duplication before the fix and renders clean after.
  5. Release: `build.gradle.kts` version bumped `2.0.2`→`2.0.3`, tag `v2.0.3` created and pushed to `Tolaseeq/aero-compose-ui`, and JitPack resolves `com.github.Tolaseeq:aero-compose-ui:2.0.3`.
**Plans**: 3 plans (3 waves)

Plans:
- [ ] 14-01-PLAN.md — Core fix: move `expandedState` sync to `SideEffect`, derive `expandedArr` from `isExpanded()`; 12 JVM tests stay GREEN (Wave 1) [RCMP-01, RCMP-02, RCMP-03, REG-01, REG-02]
- [ ] 14-02-PLAN.md — Permanent RCMP-04 recompose-during-drag repro demo in `LayoutSection.kt` (Wave 2) [RCMP-04, RCMP-01, REG-01]
- [ ] 14-03-PLAN.md — Release: bump `2.0.2`→`2.0.3`, update docs, tag + push `v2.0.3`, confirm JitPack (Wave 3) [REL-01, REL-02]
